# Modeling-a-robot-by-NN

1 torque_calc_compensate file-converts units of data and includes information like lengths of links and inertia of links of robots
2 torque_calc - contains reduced-order model, and friction model
3 torque_calc_main- import collected torques of robots and compare them with reduced-order model and friction model(from torque_calc) with plots
4 model_comp_NN_new - Neural network model with training setting
5 model_comp_NN - Neural network model(old)
